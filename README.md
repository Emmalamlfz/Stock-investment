* Making informed investment decisions by accurate prediction on stock prices and Buy-and-sell-point based on rational hypotheses.
* Provide customized asset allocation optimization solutions for clients with different investment preferences. By tailoring our services to each client's unique needs and goals, we can help them achieve long-term financial success.

* Formulate customer personas. Utilize a range of optimization algorithms and portfolio analysis tools (goal programming etc.) to model different asset allocation strategies and optimize portfolios for risk tolerance, investment horizon, and return objectives based on clients’ requirements.
